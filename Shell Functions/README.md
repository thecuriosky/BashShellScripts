Exercise 1:

Write a shell script that consists of a function that display the number of files in the present working directory. Name this function "file_count" and call it in your script. If you use a variable in your function, remember to make it a local variable.

Hint: The wc utility is used to count the number of lines, words, and bytes. Exercise 2:

Modify the script from the previous exercise. Make the "file_count" function accept a directory as an argument. Next have the function display the name of the directory followed by a colon. Finally, display the number of files to the screen on the next line. Call the function three times. First, on the "/etc" directory, next on the "/var" directory and finally on the "/usr/bin" directory.

Example output:

/etc:
