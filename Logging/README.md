Exercise 1:

Write a shell script that displays one random number to the screen and also generates a syslog message with that random number. Use the "user" facility and the "info" facility for your messages.

Hint: Use $RANDOM

Exercise 2:

Modify the previous script so that it uses a logging function. Additionally tag each syslog message with "randomly" and include the process ID. Generate 3 random numbers.
